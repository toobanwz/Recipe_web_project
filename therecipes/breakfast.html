            <p class="intro">Breakfast is the first meal of the day usually eaten in the morning. The word in English
                refers to breaking the fasting period of the previous night. Various "typical" or "traditional"
                breakfast menus exist, with food choices varying by regions and traditions worldwide.</p>

                <p class="content">Poha, also known as pauwa, sira, chira, chivda, aval or avalakki, among many other
                    names, is flattened rice originating from the Indian subcontinent. Rice is parboiled before
                    flattening so that it can be consumed with very little to no cooking. These flakes of rice swell
                    when added to liquid, whether hot or cold, as they absorb water, milk or any other liquids.</p>
