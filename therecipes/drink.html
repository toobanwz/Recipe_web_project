            <p class="intro">A drink or beverage is a liquid intended for human consumption. In addition to their basic
                function of satisfying thirst, drinks play important roles in human culture. Common types of drinks
                include plain drinking water, milk, juice, smoothies and soft drinks. Traditionally warm beverages
                include coffee, tea, and hot chocolate. Caffeinated drinks that contain the stimulant caffeine have a
                long history.</p>

                <p class="content">A sweet and refreshing strawberry milkshake is the perfect drink for summer. They can
                    be enjoyed as a healthy breakfast beverage, for an energizing snack or even as a light(er)
                    dessert.These milkshakes with strawberries can also be prepared thin or thick, however you like! I
                    often make this milkshake without ice cream, and therefore this drink has a slightly thin
                    consistency but lots of vibrant strawberry flavor.</p>
