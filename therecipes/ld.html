            <p class="intro">Lunch is a meal eaten around the middle of the day.It is commonly the second meal of the
                day, after breakfast, and varies in size by culture and region.Dinner usually refers to what is in many
                Western cultures the biggest and most formal meal of the day. Historically, the largest meal used to be
                eaten around midday, and called dinner.</p>

                <p class="content">Paneer is a fresh cheese made by curdling milk with lemon juice or vinegar. Unlike
                    American style cottage cheese that is loose and has individual curds, paneer is firm, non-melting
                    and can be easily cut into cubes.The word kadai refers to a humble piece of Indian cookware; a kadai
                    is similar to a Chinese wok, but with steeper sides and more depth. This entire dish is made in the
                    kadai, and thus the dish is named “Kadai Paneer” or “Karahi Paneer”.</p>

                <h2 class="head">PALAK ALOO</h2>
                <p class="content">There are several different types of fantastic palak-based dishes that I like to
                    make. The word palak means “spinach” in Hindi, so these dishes always include some form of fresh
                    green spinach. Therefore, palak recipes tend to be wonderfully flavorful and even healthy. The word
                    aloo refers to potatoes.Naturally vegetarian and vegan, aloo palak uses minimal spices which makes
                    it so comforting. Tastes best with flatbread like roti or paratha.</p>
